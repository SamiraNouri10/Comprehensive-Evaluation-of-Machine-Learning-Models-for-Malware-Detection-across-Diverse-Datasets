The increasing reliance on the internet and mobile devices
in our daily lives, while revolutionising how we work and interact, has
also exposed us to many cybersecurity threats. Malware, in particular,
has emerged as a significant concern due to its ability to exploit vulnera-
bilities in digital systems, compromise sensitive information, and disrupt
essential services. Traditional methods for detecting malware are often
limited in accuracy and efficiency, making them insufficient in the face
of constantly evolving threats. Machine learning (ML) offers a promising
alternative, enabling rapid and precise identification of malicious soft-
ware. However, a comprehensive evaluation of ML models across various
datasets has been lacking. In this study, we demonstrate that ML per-
formance can be significantly improved by assessing 11 machine learning
and deep learning models on nine publicly available malware datasets.
